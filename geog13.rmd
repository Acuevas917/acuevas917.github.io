In the summer of 2021, I took Geography 13 at UCSB. This class was a GIS course based in R. Here are the links to some of my work:

## [Building a project website](https://github.com/Acuevas917/acuevas917.github.io.git)

- This assignment was focused on building a static users site with Github Pages 
- It includes a github repo for access to all the code.
- As my first assignment of the quarter, there were some small obstacles. I hope to clean up my work as the class progresses.
